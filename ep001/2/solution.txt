a bit long winded so will link to articles that i referenced for static analysis of the binary and also debugging

[1] https://blog.lohr.dev/hacking-google-ctf-episode-1
[2] https://medium.com/@p-v-p/h4ck1ng-g00gl3-ep001-challenge-02-wannacry-v2-928eba571cd2

TL;DR
run strings wannacry | grep h4ck1ng
this gets us the url which gives us cryptic message
use GHIDRA to statically analyse the binary, can see that it uses current time and a wordlist to generate the current valid url to get the flag from

use gdb to debug with following commands (from [1]):
break main # we want to set a breakpoint in the main method before the software exists
run # run the program until we hit our breakpoint
jump print # continue to execute the program in the print function

this presents us with the current valid url which after interacting points us to the flag:
