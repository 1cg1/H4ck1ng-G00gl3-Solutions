downloading file and extracting we get a tar ball
extract the tar ball and we get a wannacry executable and a flag file

the flag file is encrypted and wannacry is a decryptor

running strings wannacry | grep h4ck1ng returns a url which contains 200 key files

running the brute_force script runs all keys with the decryptor and saves them as a .decrypted file

running file *.decrypted | grep -v data     returns 10 or so results that aren't gibberish 'data'

there is one ASCII text result

examining this file returns the flag:
